Lists files under a directory within the project root.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide a directory path via `path` (or `dir` / `directory`).
- Paths may be absolute or relative; relative paths are resolved against the project root.
- Any path that is outside the project root will be rejected.
- Use this to quickly discover available files before calling `Read` / `Edit` / `Write`.
