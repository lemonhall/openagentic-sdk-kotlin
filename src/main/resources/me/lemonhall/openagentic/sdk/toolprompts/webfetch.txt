- Fetches content from a specified URL
- Takes a URL and optional output controls as input
- Fetches the URL content and returns a size-bounded output to avoid context explosions
- By default returns **sanitized Markdown** (content-focused, reduces empty layout tags)
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: if another tool is present that offers better web fetching capabilities, is more targeted to the task, or has fewer restrictions, prefer using that tool instead of this one.
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - Output mode options:
      - mode="markdown" (default): content-focused Markdown (recommended for LLMs)
      - mode="clean_html": sanitized minimal HTML (basic tags + links)
      - mode="text": plain text extracted from HTML
      - mode="raw": raw response decoded as UTF-8 (dangerous; use only when necessary)
  - max_chars (default 24000): hard cap for returned text length (min 1000, max 80000)
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - If you need more than max_chars, refine the URL or fetch a more specific page/section instead of increasing the cap
