Finds files by glob pattern within the project workspace.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide `pattern` (e.g., `**/*.md`, `skills/**/SKILL.md`).
- Optional: restrict the search base with `root` (or `path`). Relative paths are resolved against the project root.
- Any path outside the project root will be rejected.
