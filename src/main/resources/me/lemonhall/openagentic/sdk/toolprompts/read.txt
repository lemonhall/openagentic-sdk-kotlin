Reads a file (text or common image types) from the project workspace.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide `file_path` (or `filePath`) as an absolute path or a project-root-relative path.
- Any path that is outside the project root will be rejected.
- Optional: `offset` (1-based) and `limit` can be used to read a slice of the file with line numbers.
- Large files are truncated (up to {{maxBytes}} bytes).
