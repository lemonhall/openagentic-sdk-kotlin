Creates or overwrites a file within the project workspace.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide `file_path` (or `filePath`) and `content`.
- Paths may be absolute or project-root-relative; any path outside the project root will be rejected.
- If overwriting an existing file is intended, set `overwrite=true`.
- Prefer `Edit` when making small, precise changes to an existing file.
