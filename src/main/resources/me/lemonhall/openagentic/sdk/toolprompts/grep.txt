Searches file contents using a regular expression within the project workspace.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide `query` (regex) and optional `file_glob` (defaults to `**/*`).
- Optional: restrict the search base with `root` (or `path`). Relative paths are resolved against the project root.
- Any path outside the project root will be rejected.
- Use `mode="files_with_matches"` to list only matched files, or omit to include per-line matches.
