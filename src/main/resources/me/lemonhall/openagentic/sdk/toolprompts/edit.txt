Performs exact string replacements in a file within the project workspace.

Project root:
- {{project_dir}}

Usage:
- Provide `file_path` (or `filePath`), `old` (or `old_string` / `oldString`), and `new` (or `new_string` / `newString`).
- Paths may be absolute or project-root-relative; any path outside the project root will be rejected.
- Use `replace_all=true` (or `count=0`) to replace all occurrences. Otherwise, a single occurrence is replaced by default.
- If `old` is not found, the tool fails.
